    <p>TAP-NY was founded in 2008 by <strong>Wei-En Lee</strong> and <strong>Michelle Hsieh</strong> as a 
    provisional chapter of TACL’s ﬂedgling TAP network. In 2009, <strong>Bob Wu</strong> 
    assumed leadership of TAP-NY and by the end of the year, he had 
    formed the founding board and started holding regular events under 
    the TAP-NY name. By early 2010, TACL granted TAP-NY ofﬁcial chapter 
    status after fulﬁlling guidelines for the sustainability of the organization. </p>

Michael eventually got bored of the beautiful weather in CA and journeyed east, where he is now a Senior Product Designer at Brooklyn-based design studio Huge. When he’s not staring at a computer screen, Michael is probably either biking around aimlessly, climbing at Brooklyn Boulders, or stuck in a four hour client meeting somewhere.</p>

        <p>Victor grew up on Long Island, NY. He went to MIT where he studied Computer Science and Engineering. After founding his first startup didn’t work out, Victor decided the next best thing was to move to NYC where he got a job doing machine learning work for Meetup. He currently is a full-stack software engineer at MongoDB, a database technology startup.<br />
        Victor likes exploring the NYC tech/startup scene, playing basketball and volleyball, and talking about education and psychology. He attempts to stay in touch with his Taiwanese roots by amassing reusable plastic bags, having soy milk at breakfast, and watching Taiwanese television shows. Victor hopes to help TAP members foster their entrepreneurial spirit by empowering them with the resources to pursue their own ideas and maybe even launch their own companies someday.</p>

        <p>Vivian is a Cali girl through and through, born and raised in a suburb in the LA area, and this shows in her ability to wear flip flops in 50 degree weather and punctuate her statements with “yo” and “man”. She moved to the chilly East Coast to attend the University of Pennsylvania’s undergraduate business program at the Wharton School, concentrating in Finance and Marketing. Vivian is currently employed at American Express in a Marketing role, and encourages everyone to get an Amex card. She spends her free time eating her way through as many restaurants as possible (and reviewing them on Yelp), regularly singing her heart out at karaoke (always looking for new karaoke buddies), and curling up with a good book (her favorite genre being fantasy, yes she’s nerdy like that). She is thrilled to be joining the TAP-NY board, and can’t wait to help build an even larger community of Taiwanese-Americans and make it’s next year better than ever!</p>
