    <p>TAP-NY rung in the New Year with a bang and we’re just getting started! It’s hard to believe that seven years ago, TAP had its first Lunar New Year banquet with 15 people at one cramped but festive table. This year, 200 people celebrated the Year of the Horse with TAP, an auspicious beginning to our goals for the year.</p>

    <p>I wanted to give you a closer look at what’s in store for TAP in 2014 and what we hope to accomplish with your help! As a board, we have a relentless focus on building a strong and united Taiwanese American community in New York City. We really believe that only by working (and playing) together can we tap into our boundless potential – both as individuals and as a community.</p>

    <p>One of our biggest initiatives this year is to make sure that we are building thriving communities around your interests and passions. Whether you want to make VP at an investment bank, get more in touch with your heritage through some karaoke, or be a good person and do community service, we want to provide avenues for you to achieve that – all while connecting you with like-minded and, of course, awesome people.</p>

    <p>Essentially, we want to bring folks closer together. We saw a lot of success with many of our sports teams (softball, football, volleyball, basketball – dodgeball, you’re next!) and we want to recreate that same collegial environment if you’re gunning to join the New York tech scene or just want to brush up on your Mandarin.</p>

    <p>We also want to collaborate more with other organizations locally and nationally. We’re in the greatest city in the world so we should take advantage of that! At the same time, we’re Taiwanese Americans, not Taiwanese New Yorkers, so you’ll see more events with other TAPs across the country. Want to chill on a mountain with TAP Boston and TAP DC? Come to our ski trip at the end of this month.</p>

    <p>Perhaps most importantly, we’re working to bring in greater involvement from our amazing base of members. We’re 5,000 people strong and I know that at least some of you want to help out. From our pillar events like TAP Olympics, the Entrepreneur Challenge and Competition, or Night Market to smaller programs like our sports teams, there’s no shortage of things that you could contribute to.</p>

    <p>We’d love to see you get more involved with TAP in any way that you can. Drop me a line at hello@tap-ny.org and let’s chat.</p>

    <p>In short, TAP is really here to serve you, our members. We’re proud to be part of such a vibrant community and we want to ensure that we’re all helping each other out to thrive personally and professionally.</p>

    <p>So come out to TAP events and meet the people who could become your new BFF or give you your next job; volunteer with us; give us ideas on how to improve; and of course, have fun!</p>
